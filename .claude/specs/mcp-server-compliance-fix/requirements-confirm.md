# MCP Server Compliance Fix - Requirements Confirmation

## Original Request
Debug MCP service connection issue where client receives HTML (`<!DOCTYPE`) instead of expected JSON, with full compliance check against MCP 2025-06-18 specification.

## Requirements Analysis

### Current Quality Score: 85/100

### 1. Functional Clarity (25/30 points)
**Issue Identified**: Client expects JSON manifest but receives HTML document
**Expected Behavior**: 
- MCP client connects to server at specified endpoint
- Server should respond with proper JSON-RPC 2.0 messages
- Initialization flow should work according to MCP 2025-06-18 spec

**Missing Details (5 points deducted)**:
- What specific MCP client is being used?
- What is the exact server endpoint configuration?
- Are there specific error patterns in server logs?

### 2. Technical Specificity (20/25 points) 
**Based on Specification Analysis**:
- Must follow JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol exactly
- Server must support proper initialization lifecycle
- Tools capability must be properly declared and implemented
- HTTP transport must follow Streamable HTTP specification

**Missing Details (5 points deducted)**:
- Current server architecture details
- Specific transport mechanism being used
- Client configuration details

### 3. Implementation Completeness (25/25 points)
**Comprehensive Specification Review Required**:
- ✅ Basic Protocol compliance (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- ✅ Lifecycle management (initialization, operation, shutdown)
- ✅ Transport layer (Streamable HTTP)
- ✅ Server capabilities (tools, resources, prompts)
- ✅ Error handling patterns
- ✅ Security considerations

### 4. Business Context (15/20 points)
**Value**: Fix MCP server to enable proper client connections
**Priority**: High - server currently non-functional
**Impact**: Enable MCP tooling integration

**Missing Context (5 points deducted)**:
- Production vs development environment
- Timeline constraints
- Performance requirements

## Clarification Questions

### Q1: Server Environment & Configuration
- What MCP client are you using (Claude Desktop, VS Code extension, custom client)?
- What is your current server endpoint URL and port?
- Can you share your server startup logs?

### Q2: Current Implementation Details
- What transport mechanism is your server using (stdio vs HTTP)?
- What framework/language is the server built with?
- Do you have existing code that handles JSON-RPC requests?

### Q3: Error Context
- When exactly does the HTML response occur (during initialization, tool listing, tool calling)?
- Are there any CORS errors in browser developer tools?
- What's the complete error message including stack trace?

### Q4: Expected Functionality
- What tools/capabilities should your MCP server expose?
- Do you need to support both /mcp and /mcp/{user_id} endpoints as mentioned earlier?
- Any specific authentication or session management requirements?

## Documentation Status
- Requirements confirmation process: In Progress
- Specification compliance checklist: 85% complete
- Implementation gaps: To be identified after clarification
